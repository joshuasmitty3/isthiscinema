# Development Guidelines

## Core Rules

1. **Planning First**
   - Explain proposed changes and get confirmation before implementation
   - Document the planned approach
   - Wait for approval before proceeding with code changes

2. **Simplicity and Modularity**
   - Start with the simplest working solution
   - Break down functionality into modules
   - Avoid over-engineering initial implementations

3. **Code Reusability**
   - Check existing codebase for similar solutions before writing new code
   - Avoid duplicate code
   - Leverage existing components and utilities

These guidelines should be followed for all development work on this project.
